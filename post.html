        <h1> Started learning front end development</h1>
        <p>  After years of soul searching, denial and fear, I finally chose to learn frontend development and switch careers from cybersecurity.</p>

        <p><b> How I stay committed to learning </b></p><br>
            <span class="details"> I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</span> </p> <br>
            <span class="details"> While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</span> </p>  <br>

        <p><b> How I got started </b></p><br>
            <span class="details"> I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</span> </p>  <br>
            <span class="details"> That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</span> </p>  <br>
